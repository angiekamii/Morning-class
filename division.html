    <p style="text-align: justify">Although mental health is a fundamental component of health, recognition of mental disorders and awareness about its importance is limited. Stigma and lack of understanding about mental disorders are major barriers to seeking help and promoting better mental health. Increasing understanding and overcoming stigma through strategic communications and social mobilization are crucial steps towards strengthening mental health programmes.
Mental health promotion involves actions that improve psychological well-being. There are a number of ways to promote mental health, including early childhood interventions; support to children; socio-economic empowerment; social support for elderly populations; programmes targeted at vulnerable people; mental health promotional activities in schools; mental health interventions at work; violence prevention programmes; and anti-discrimination laws and campaigns. Mental health promotion should be mainstreamed into governmental and non-governmental policies and programmes. In addition to the health sector, it is essential to involve the education, labour, justice, transport, environment, housing, and welfare sectors.

        <h1 style="color: #37a1a1"><u>ABOUT</u></h1>
        <p>The first contact a defendant has with the criminal justice system is usually with the police (or law enforcement) who investigates the suspected wrongdoing and makes an arrest, but if the suspect is dangerous to the whole nation, a national level law enforcement agency is called in. When warranted, law enforcement agencies or police officers are empowered to use force and other forms of legal coercion and means to effect public and social order.The term is most commonly associated with police departments of a state that are authorized to exercise the police power of that state within a defined legal or territorial area of responsibility. </p>
